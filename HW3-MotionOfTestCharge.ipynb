    "## Modeling motion\n",
    "Sometimes, you will want to model the motion of a test charge in the presence of a given field. We can do this using by seperating our second-order differential equation into two first order differential equations. The differential equation that you obtained had the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ddot{x} = f(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $f$ if the acceleration, which depends on the position of the object. Using a ```while``` loop, we are unable to directly model the motion dictated by this differential equation directly. Instead, we must construct two first order equations, one for $x$ and one for $v$. This is a common practice for numerically solving differential equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dot{v} = f(x)$$\n",
    "$$\\dot{x} = v$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the second differential equation is just the definition of velocity. We can rewrite the above equations in a \"iterative\" format that a computer will understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$v_f = v_i + f(x)*dt$$\n",
    "$$x_f = x_i + v_f*dt$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique is called [Euler-Cromer integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-implicit_Euler_method) and is one of the simplest form of numerical integration. Numerical integration techniques are widely varying in their speed and accuracy, but the Euler-Cromer method is a good first one to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem to solve\n",
    "In this notebook, we have set up a simulation that begins to model the motion of a 1$\\mu C$ charge in the presence of a ring of charge (radius $1m$ and charge $1mC$). The test charge has a mass of $1g$. The simulation should use two models - 1. the full differential equation and 2. the approximate (linearized) differential equation. The code should output two graphs (position vs time for each solution) after the integration of both has completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of this problem is for you to explain the output of each model and its assumptions. We also ask that you determine under what conditions the approximate model is a good one and explain how you know. Below, we have annotated the simulation."
